	(j) Start to create a series of tutorial samples, but tutorial samples are not completed yet.

18.	SocketPro Version 4.0.4.8
	(a) Updated the file usktpror.dll to version 4.0.4.8. Now When a client sends a message to the ip
	address any "0.0.0.0", SocketPro server will sends all of clients except the clients having sidStartup
	the message.

17.	SocketPro Version 4.0.4.7
	(a) Largely reduce thread contention and improve concurrency of usocket.dll over a machine with multiple CPUs.
	(b) Chat service methods SpeakTo and SpeakToEx specifically support ip addresses "255.255.255.255" (ip address none)
	and "0.0.0.0" (ip address any). When a client sends a message to such the two IP addresses, SocketPro server
	will immeadiately reflect the message back to the client without regularly seeking a socket session. 
		
16.	SocketPro Version 4.0.4.6
	(a) Add exchanging client and server operation system information. After calling IUSocket::SwitchTo,
	you can query operating system about a peered machine.
	(b) Online compressing is enabled by default. In most cases, this modification inproves performnave. 
	However, this change may decreases the performance if network bandwidth is very high.
 
15.	SocketPro Version 4.0.4.5
	(a) Modified SocketPro zip engine so that it supports multiple deflations concurrently
	within multiple CPU processors. Data inflation is also improved somewhat. Online compressing is 
	largely improved.
	(b) Found a potential bug related with the feature Cancel, which may result in 100% CPU rate 
	with both SocketPro client and server components, usocket.dll and usktpror.dll.
	(c) Fix two bugs in udb.dll (client remote database service).
	(d) Add support to data types DBTYPE_ARRAY|DBTYPE_XX, and convert them into DBTYPE_VARIANT.
	(e) Modify RemoteConnector so that it supports window system logon.

14.	SocketPro Version 4.0.4.4
	(a) Fix a critical bug that may crash a SocketPro server application if a chat message is
	larger than 128 bytes.
	(b) Modify uodbsvr.dll (remote database service server module, version 4.0.4.4) so that 
	all of BLOB fields will be directly fetched without batching at server side. For all of 
	non-BLOB fields, remote database service server module still batches records at server side.
	It speeds up retrieving BLOBs fields from a remote server.

13.	SocketPro Version 4.0.4.3
	(a) Fix the problem (uodbsvr.dll) of positioning the cursor wrongly when updating records 
	    if a client calls any one of IURowset::MoveFirst, IURowset::MoveNext, IURowset::MovePrev 
	    and IURowset::MoveLast.
	(b) Recompiled usktpror.dll.

12.	SocketPro Version 4.0.4.2
	(a) Recompiled usktpror.dll and uodbsvr.dll without fixing any bug.
	(b) Fix the bug of DB_S_ENDOFROWSET in the udb.dll problem.

11.	SocketPro Version 4.0.4.1
	(a) Add two methods PushBytes and PopBytes into the COM object UQueue.
	(b) Move the event OnSSLEvent from the structure CSvsContext into global.
	    Now, you need to call SetOnSSLEvent for subscribing the event.
	(c) Update both C++ and dotNet versions of SocketProAdapter and related samples
	    because of the change (b).
	(d) Fix one bug of C++ version SocketProAdapter related with OnClose event.
 
10.	SocketPro Version 4.0.3.1
	(a) Add a new event (OnThreadCreated) into usktpror.dll for tracking a just created thread.
	(b) Update both C++ and dotNet versions of SocketProAdapter.
	(c) Recompile affected sample projects.

9.	SocketPro Version 4.0.2.6
	(a) Fix a minior bug involved with asynchronously resovling IP address by name.
	(b) Fix the bug that client socket may prompt a wrong error message if SSL is used at client 
	    but the remote SocketPro server is not enabled with SSL.
	(c) Fix COM object sink interface leak problems of UFile and UDB libraries.
	(d) Add a COM object utility (UQueue) for assisting client side development with high level lenguages like VB6.

8.	SocketPro Version 4.0.2.5
	(a) Add the function GetRequestIDsInQueue to SocketPro server library usktpror.dll.
	(b) Modify SocketProAdapters (C++ and DotNet) to support the newly added function.
	(c) Re-write and tune database service uodbsvr.dll from SocketProAdapter, and improve its performance somewhat.
	(d) Fix two minor bugs inside SocketProAdapter and usocket.dll

7.	SocketPro Version 4.0.2.4
	(a) Sybchronize socket event OnClose with OnSlowRequestArrive event. With this version, there is
	    no need to Sybchronize non-global/static data. It dramatically reduces data synchronization complexity in
	    multithreading environment.
	(b) ufilesvr is re-written with C++ SocketProAdapter instead of C APIs.
	(c) Fix the bug of crashing application when killing an console application without properly shutting down a server.
	(d) Fix the bug that SocketPro server can't clean a dead socket session because of an abnormal network disconnection
	    while SocketPro server is processing a slow request for the socket session.
	(e) Fix a minor bug within client UFile.dll.

6.	SocketPro Version 4.0.2.3
 	(a) SocketProAdapter is re-written for easy dotNet and C++ developments.
	(b) Re-write the sampes UDemo, testSktPro, SimpleSocketAsp, DotNetSvrOne, and SendObject.
	(c) CUQueue supports serializing and de-serializing objects through dotnet BinaryFormatter and SoapFormatter.
	(d) Fix usocket.dll emitting a wrong event for closing a SSL socket connection.
	(e) Fix that usktpror.dll wrongly calls the event OnThreadStarted.
	(f) Closes all of its socket connections when removing a service ID or a library.
	(g) Add two VB.Net smaples SocketProVBNet and SendObjectVBNet.
	(h) Add a object pool to store discarded CClientPeer objects.
	(i) Fix a memory leaking in uodbsvr.dll when a socket session is closed while fetching records is in processing.
		
5.	SocketPro Version 4.0.2.2
	(a) Fix ISocketBase::GetHostByName and ISocketBase::GetHostByAddr 
	    for asynchronously resolving hosting when a window handle is not available.
	(b) Fix the problem that a client can not call IUSocket::WaitAll from a thread that
	    doesn't create a hidden window handle for a socket connection. 

4.	SocketPro version 4.0.2.1 
	(a) Change tagSocketType.stpeDGRAM into tagSocketType.stDGRAM.
	(b) Fix a CUQueue problem for poping a variant having an array of strings.
	(c) Support pushing and poping a variant with data type VT_FILETIME.
	(d) SocketProAdapter for dotNet platform is completed. 
	    Its CUQueue supports both serializing and deserializing both native and managed data types.

3.	Updated the files usktpror.dll (4.0.1.3) and usocket.dll (4.0.1.3) 
	(a) Decrease CPU rate and thread context switch with 10 Mbps LAN.

2.	Modified the file usktpror.dll (4.0.1.2) on 06/04/04
	(a) fix high server CPU rate problem when uploading a file from a client to a remote server.
        (b) Improve performance for sending a large number of bytes.
	(c) Decrease thread context switch for exchanging large number of data.
	(d) Use OpenSSL version 9.7d instead of 9.7a.

1.	SocketPro version 4.0.1.1 is initially released on 06/01/04.
