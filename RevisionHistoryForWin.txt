	It speeds up retrieving BLOBs fields from a remote server.

13.	SocketPro Version 4.0.4.3
	(a) Fix the problem (uodbsvr.dll) of positioning the cursor wrongly when updating records 
	    if a client calls any one of IURowset::MoveFirst, IURowset::MoveNext, IURowset::MovePrev 
	    and IURowset::MoveLast.
	(b) Recompiled usktpror.dll.

12.	SocketPro Version 4.0.4.2

	(a) Add two methods PushBytes and PopBytes into the COM object UQueue.
	(b) Move the event OnSSLEvent from the structure CSvsContext into global.
	    Now, you need to call SetOnSSLEvent for subscribing the event.
	(c) Update both C++ and dotNet versions of SocketProAdapter and related samples
	    because of the change (b).
	(d) Fix one bug of C++ version SocketProAdapter related with OnClose event.

	(b) Fix the bug that client socket may prompt a wrong error message if SSL is used at client 
	    but the remote SocketPro server is not enabled with SSL.
	(c) Fix COM object sink interface leak problems of UFile and UDB libraries.
	(d) Add a COM object utility (UQueue) for assisting client side development with high level lenguages like VB6.

8.	SocketPro Version 4.0.2.5
	(a) Add the function GetRequestIDsInQueue to SocketPro server library usktpror.dll.
	(b) Modify SocketProAdapters (C++ and DotNet) to support the newly added function.
	(c) Re-write and tune database service uodbsvr.dll from SocketProAdapter, and improve its performance somewhat.
	(d) Fix two minor bugs inside SocketProAdapter and usocket.dll

7.	SocketPro Version 4.0.2.4
	(a) Sybchronize socket event OnClose with OnSlowRequestArrive event. With this version, there is
	    no need to Sybchronize non-global/static data. It dramatically reduces data synchronization complexity in
	    multithreading environment.
	(b) ufilesvr is re-written with C++ SocketProAdapter instead of C APIs.
	(c) Fix the bug of crashing application when killing an console application without properly shutting down a server.
	(d) Fix the bug that SocketPro server can't clean a dead socket session because of an abnormal network disconnection
	    while SocketPro server is processing a slow request for the socket session.
	(e) Fix a minor bug within client UFile.dll.

6.	SocketPro Version 4.0.2.3
 	(a) SocketProAdapter is re-written for easy dotNet and C++ developments.
	(b) Re-write the sampes UDemo, testSktPro, SimpleSocketAsp, DotNetSvrOne, and SendObject.
	(c) CUQueue supports serializing and de-serializing objects through dotnet BinaryFormatter and SoapFormatter.
	(d) Fix usocket.dll emitting a wrong event for closing a SSL socket connection.
	(e) Fix that usktpror.dll wrongly calls the event OnThreadStarted.
	(f) Closes all of its socket connections when removing a service ID or a library.
	(g) Add two VB.Net smaples SocketProVBNet and SendObjectVBNet.
	(h) Add a object pool to store discarded CClientPeer objects.
	(i) Fix a memory leaking in uodbsvr.dll when a socket session is closed while fetching records is in processing.

	    doesn't create a hidden window handle for a socket connection. 

4.	SocketPro version 4.0.2.1 
	(a) Change tagSocketType.stpeDGRAM into tagSocketType.stDGRAM.
	(b) Fix a CUQueue problem for poping a variant having an array of strings.
	(c) Support pushing and poping a variant with data type VT_FILETIME.
	(d) SocketProAdapter for dotNet platform is completed. 
	    Its CUQueue supports both serializing and deserializing both native and managed data types.

3.	Updated the files usktpror.dll (4.0.1.3) and usocket.dll (4.0.1.3) 
	(a) Decrease CPU rate and thread context switch with 10 Mbps LAN.

2.	Modified the file usktpror.dll (4.0.1.2) on 06/04/04
