<h1 style="text-align: center;">SQL Requests Streaming For MySQL/MariaDB</h1>
<hr />
<p>The <a href="py_sqlite.htm" title="SQL Requests Streaming For SQLite">previous article</a> has dicussed SocketPro SQL requests streaming for SQLite.
In fact, SocketPro has already come with a number of plugins to support SQL requests streaming processing for various other databases such as MySQL and MariaDB as well as all databases supporting ODBC protocol.
All of them shares the same set of API functions that are created with continuous in-line request/result batching, real-time stream sending/processing, asynchronous data transferring and parallel computation in mind.</p>

<p>This is the second article to demonstrate SocketPro SQL requests streaming technology for MySQL and MariaDB.
First, we will talk about store procedure. Afterwards, we spend most of the article on setting MySQL/MariaDB server plugins across different versions.</p>

<p>This unit test code comes from the file ../socketpro/stream_sql/mysql/test_python/test_python.py.</p>

<p>First, you will find the left code snippet 1 is nearly the same as the code snippet 2 within the <a href="py_sqlite.htm" title="SQL Requests Streaming For SQLite">first SQL requests streaming article</a>, because SocketPro defines a set of API functions at client side for all database management systems.
However, there is a new unit test method <i>TestStoredProcedure</i> defined at line 60.
Further, this unit test method <i>TestBatch</i> has an extra parameter <i>vData</i> at line 61 to receive output parameter data from MySQL/MariaDB by executing some stored procedure, in comparison to the line 53 of the code snippet 2 of the <a href="py_sqlite.htm" title="SQL Requests Streaming For SQLite">previous article</a>.
</p>
<p>Here, we like to use this article to show you how to deal with stored procedure within SocketPro. We ignore others that had already been detailed at the <a href="py_sqlite.htm" title="SQL Requests Streaming For SQLite">previous article</a>.</p>
<p>First, we call the method <i>TestStoredProcedure</i> at line 60.
The method returns a future object <i>fStore</i> for a <i>SQLExeInfo</i> structure and an array of parameters <i>vPData</i> from MySQL database backend in the future.
Similarly, executing the method <i>TestBatch</i> at line 61 will return a new future object <i>fStore1</i> for a new <i>SQLExeInfo</i> structure and a new array of parameters <i>vData</i> from MySQL database backend in the future.
</p>
<p>Keep in mind that all SQL requests and sub requests inside unit test functions (<i>TestCreateTables</i>, <i>TestPreparedStatements</i>, <i>TestBLOBByPreparedStatement</i>, <i>TestStoredProcedure</i> and <i>TestBatch</i>) from line 54 through 61 will be streamed within inline batching for the best network efficiency at client side.
All of them are immediately returned with future objects without waiting for responses from backend database. Further, it is expected that all returned results will be streamed at server side with inline batching too.
Finally, we are waiting all expected future results from line 64 though 76.</p>
<p>
At last, we show all collected rowsets from line 87 through 93.
</p>
<p>We are going to discuss the unit test functions <i>TestStoredProcedure</i> and <i>TestBatch</i> with details using the below code snippets 2 and 3, respectively.</p>

    # send multiple sets of parameter data in one shot
    return mysql.execute(vData, cbRows, cbRowHeader), vData
</pre>
</td>

<p>First of all, the prepared stored procedure at line 7 of the left code snippet 2 has three parameters.
The first parameter is an input. The second one is an input-output. The last one is an output.
The stored procedure represents all types of parameters which a stored procedure can possibly have. </p>
<p>Inside the unit test function, we use two callbacks <i>cbRows</i> and <i>cbRowHeader</i> at line 9.
They are going to be used for dealing with record data and column meta information as described at the <a href="py_sqlite.htm" title="SQL Requests Streaming For SQLite">previous article</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we prepare two sets of parameter data at line 5.
These output data at line 5 are used to receive data from backend MySQL database in the future. Also, the input-output parameter data at line 5 will be reset to new data in the future.</p>
<p>At end, we execute stored procedure with multiple sets of parameters in one shot at line 9, which will return mutiple rowsets and output data.
After comparing this unit test funtion with the unit test function <i>TestPreparedStatements</i> described at the <a href="py_sqlite.htm" title="SQL Requests Streaming For SQLite">previous article</a>, 
you will find that both are nearly the same without huge difference at all.
</p>
<p>When running the unit test code, you can debug for returning output data at line 72 of the above code snippet 1 by setting a break point.</p>

<p>The left code snippet 3 is nearly the same at the code snippet 6 within the <a href="py_sqlite.htm" title="SQL Requests Streaming For SQLite">previous article</a>, although this one has more lines of codes with BLOBs and long texts transferred back and forth between client and server.
It is noted that SocketPro server plugins support user-defined delimiters which can be one single character or a string. Here, it is a character, vertical bar, as commented at line 2.
</p>
<p>We intentionally use a complex test case to show you the power of SocketPro SQL requests streaming technology. In fact, the unit test code here is not complicate at all, but its test case is considerably challenging to you if you use other DB accessing APIs, because the test case is involved with transferring large BLOBs and long texts back and forth.</p>

Code snippet 3: Call executeBatch against a MySQL/MariaDB database with user defined delimilter and stored procedure as well as input, input/output and output parameters in batch
<hr />

<p>We are going to install database plugins within MySQL version 8 or later, MySQL version 5.7 or earlier, and MariaDB.
However, it is a must that you have already distributed server core library (libuservercore.so for linux or uservercore.dll for windows) as described at <a href="get_started.htm" title="Get Started With SocketPro">this article</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Copy SocketPro MySQL/MariaDB DB plugin into database plugin dirtectory, and install the plugin
    <ol>
        <p>
        <li>Finding MySQL/MariaDB database plugin directory by executing statement <i><b>show variables where variable_name='plugin_dir'</b></i></li>
        <li>Copying MySQL/MariaDB plugin into database plugin directory and installing the plugin
            <ul>
                <li><b>Windows</b>: Copy smysql.dll at ../socketpro/bin/free_services/(mysql8_0_11|mysql5_7_22|mariadb)/win64 (or win86) into the above found database plugin directory.
                Afterwards, execute the statement <i><b>INSTALL PLUGIN UDAParts_SQL_Streaming SONAME 'smysql.dll'</b></i>.</li>
                <li><b>Linux</b>: Copy libsmysql.so at ../socketpro/bin/free_services/(mysql8_0_11|mysql5_7_22|mariadb)/ into the above found database plugin directory.
                Afterwards, execute the statement <i><b>INSTALL PLUGIN UDAParts_SQL_Streaming SONAME 'libsmysql.so'</b></i>.</li>
            </ul>
            Make sure there is no error output before continuing to the next step. The directories, <i>mysql8_0_11</i>, <i>mysql5_7_22</i> and <i>mariadb</i>, contain one DB plugin for MySQL 8 or later, MySQL 5.7 or earlier, and MariaDB, respectively. Don't make a mistake here.
        </li>
        <li>Go to MySQL/MariaDB database data directory, which can be found by executing the query <i><b>show variables where variable_name='datadir'</b></i>.
        Afterwards, you can find the two generated files, sp_streaming_db_config.json and streaming_db.log, for other advanced settings and error outputs, respectively.
        In case there is an error output, the file streaming_db.log will very likely give you a hint to help.
        By this time, you can successfully run the test sample script.</li>
        </p>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Install a sample database <i>sakila</i>
<p>This step is optional. However, it is highly recommended because we extensively use sakila as a sample database.
If your MySQL/MariaDB doesn’t have sakila database installed, you can get it from a site by searching github and sakila.
You will find many sites having SQL scripts for installing the famous sample database <i>sakila</i>.
As an example, <a href="https://github.com/ivanceras/sakila" title="GitHub - ivanceras/sakila: Sakila sample database for each database platform">this site</a> may work for you.
</p>
</li>

<li>Configure SocketPro MySQL/MariaDB DB plugin for advanced features by modifying the file sp_streaming_db_config.json
    <p>The coming configurations are also optional. They are presented here for advanced features and other services.</p>
<ol>
    <li>First of all, find entry <i><b>services</b></i>, and change its string value to <i>ssqlite;uasyncqueue</i>.
    The MySQL/MariaDB database server plugin is going to load the two services <a href="get_started.htm" title="Get Started With SocketPro">(sqlite and server persistent queue)</a>.
    You can do so for other services. Each of services should be separated by the charactor semi-colon.
    </li>
    <li>
    Next, find entry <i><b>monitored_tables</b></i>, and change its string value to <i>sakila.actor;sakila.country;sakila.category;sakila.language</i>.
    Doing so will force the MySQL/MariaDB database server plugin to monitor insert, update and delete trigger events for the four tables, actor, country, category and language.
    SocketPro use these trigger events for real-time cache at client or middle tier side.
    </li>
    <li>Stop MySQL/MariaDB database server, and restart it. By this time, the configuartion file will be updated.
    In case there is an error, the log file streaming_db.log will help you out.
    </li>
    <li>The following steps are NOT necessary for MySQL 8 or later at all. However, if you use MySQL <b>5.7 or earlier</b>, or MariaDB, follow the following two steps to complete the previous setting 2:
        <p>Register a user defined function <i><b>SetSQLStreamingPlugin</b></i> by executing the statement <i><b>CREATE FUNCTION SetSQLStreamingPlugin RETURNS INTEGER SONAME 'libsmysql.so'</b></i> and <i><b>CREATE FUNCTION SetSQLStreamingPlugin RETURNS INTEGER SONAME 'smysql.dll'</b></i>, respectively on Linux and Windows platforms.</p>
        <p>At last, call the user defined function <i><b>SetSQLStreamingPlugin</b></i> by executing a statement like <i><b>select SetSQLStreamingPlugin('uid=root;pwd=Smash123')</b></i>.
        Here, the parameters <i>uid</i> and <i>pwd</i> represent user id and password, respectively.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In case you know C#, you can compile the real-time cache feature by compiling and running the test project at the directory ../socketpro/stream_sql/mysql/test_cache.</li>
</ol>
    <br />
    If the above configurations are completed correctly without any error, these SocketPro DB server plugins will support SocketPro server persistent message, SQLite, SQL requests streaming processing, and real-time updateable cache services.
    Further, these SocketPro DB server plugins will use database accounts to authenticate clients for all of these services.
    <br /><br />
    Certainly, you can turn on SSL/TSLv1.x for secure communication, change listening port, and modify settings for SocketPro server persistent message and SQLite services too.
    It is noted that some of entries within the configuration file is read-only just for your information.
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>By this time, you can set break points at lines 72 and 77 of the above snippet 1 to see the changes in variables <i>vPData</i>, <i>vData</i>, <i>ra</i> and various future objects as well as console outputs.
At end, SocketPro MySQL/MariaDB DB plugins are written from C/C++.
Their projects are located at the directories ../socketpro/stream_sql/mysql/smysql and ../socketpro/stream_sql/mariadb/smysql.
Like SocketPro SQLite plugin, the MySQL/MariaDB plugins are not complicate at all in implementation.
In fact, they are small, simple and understandable to a middle or senior level of C++ software engineer.</p>

<p>
If you meet an issue like connecting issue, you can check the log file <i>streaming_db.log</i> for help.
If you can understand C/C++ code, you can quickly and accurately find the cause of a connection issue by looking at a line code of cpp file from the log file.
</p>

<p>
These MySQL/MariaDB plugins are free to the public individuals for you to study and experiment.
It is noted that they are not free to companies or enterprises for commercial usages.
However, these plugins can be easily modified to meet the needs of enterprise applications.
