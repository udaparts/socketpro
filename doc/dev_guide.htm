<h2>SocketPro Development Guide</h2>
<hr />
<p>SocketPro is next generation technology that streams both requests and responses. 
It is written from scratch with continuous in-line request/result batching, real-time stream sending/processing, asynchronous data transferring and parallel computation in mind.
SocketPro offers superior performance and scalability with many unique and critical features.
These features will definitely solve your daunting issues and meet complex needs.
Consequently, SocketPro will help you quickly develop high-quality distributed applications on major platforms such as Windows, Linux variants and browsers as well as Apple and devices in the future.
