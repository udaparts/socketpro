<h1 style="text-align: center;">SocketPro Secure Communication and Publish/Subscribe Messaging</h1>

<p>We talked about client side development at <a href="cs_hw.htm", title="SocketPro Client Server Application Development">the previous article</a>.
Now, we are going to describe SocektPro server side development here.
Most of this paper will focus on publish/subscribe messaging and SocketPro secure communication between client and server.</p>

<p>Let's start with server side. The sample server project is located at ../socketpro/tutorials/csharp/pub_sub/ps_server.</p>

It is very simple to start a server as shown at the left code snippet 1.
<p>At first, we tell SocketPro that we are going to start a secure socket at line 6 through 13.
UDAParts already prepares test certificates and a private key for your experiment convenience as commented.
SocketPro server will be non-secure if the piece of code doesn't exist.
</p>

<p>This sample server is running on the listening port 20901, as shown at line 15.</p>

<p>The left code snippet 2 is really simple too.</p>
<p>First, pay attention to the line 3. An attribute <i>ServiceAttr</i> is set for a service id <i>hwConst.sidHelloWorld</i>.
Afterwards, we initialize a private member <i>m_HelloWorld</i> for a hello world service at line 4.
As commented, we can set up any number of services here. Each of them must have an attribute defined with a unique service id.
</p>
<p>The virtual method <i>OnSettingServer</i> at line 7 will be called, when we start a listening socket at line 15 of the above code snippet 1.
Inside the function, we set authentication method at line 10. Afterwards, we create three topics or chat groups at line 12 through 14 because this sample is going to demonstrate publish/subscribe messaging.
A client can subscribe zero, one or multiple topics.
However, anyone of clients is capable to send a message onto other clients with server in middle, according to their zero, one or more topics (or groups) subscribed. A sample will be given at the below code snippet 3.
At end, we return true at line 16. As commented, there is a listenting socket for accepting coming client sessions if the method returns true.
Otherwise, there is no listening socket at all. Further, the hello world service is registerred into SocketPro server to be ready for functioning.
</p>
<p>When a client will ask for a service indicated by the variable <i>nSvsId</i> after establishing a socket connection,
the virtual method <i>OnIsPermitted</i> at line 19 will be called by SocketPro server. Inside the method, we do authentication from given user id <i>userId</i> and its password <i>password</i>.
If the method returns true, a permision is given. Otherwise, socket connection is closed immediately for autentication failure.
It is noted that the password will be cleaned from server right after the virtual function is called.

The left snippet 3 shows how server side processes three requests (SayHello, Sleep and Echo) within hello world micro service. One instance of HelloWorldPeer corresponds to one client.
<p>The virtual function OnSwitchFrom will be called right after a session is permitted at the line 21 of the above snippet 2.
The parameter oldServiceId will be 256 (SocketProAdapter.BaseServiceID.sidStartup).
We can subscribe zero, one or more topics or groups as shown at line 15 at server side. You can do so too at client side.
Doing so indicates the client is interested in all messages belonging to topics 1 and 3.</p>
<p><i>SayHello</i>: The method <i>SayHello</i> has an attribute <i>RequestAttr</i> with a request id <i>hwConst.idSayHelloHelloWorld</i>, as shown at line 20.
Inside the method, it may throw an exception of CServerError at line 28 if the first name <i>firstName</i> is an empty string.
Also, we publish a message to all clients subscribed for topics 2 and 3 at line 32.
At end, the method returns a string <i>str</i> to its connected client. It is noted that this method is processed within one of main threads.
A SocketPro server has one or more threads to process all fast requests which take less time to process.
The max number of main threads cannot be over the number of server machine processors.
</p>
<p><i>Sleep</i>: The method has an attibute defined at line 39 too.
Further, the attribute takes a second input <i>true</i>, which tells SocketPro server that this method requires a long time to process within a worker thread instead of a main thread.
When a SocketPro server meets such a slow request, it will either create a thread or reuse a thread from a thread pool at run time before dispatching the request onto it for processing.
SocketPro server totally manages worker threads for you. However, you are required to tell server what requests are slow as shown at line 39.
When such a request is completed, the worker thread will be recycled into a hidden pool for reuse in the future.
Also, we may throw a new server exception at line 46 if the input <i>ms</i> is less than 0. The method <i>Sleep</i> returns nothing.
</p>

<p><i>Echo</i>: The method is simple as it just returns the input <i>ms</i> back to a client at line 54. 
Please refer to the <a href="cs_buffer.htm" title="SocketPro Request Parameters Packing and Result Unpacking">previous article</a> for serialization and de-serialization of complex structure.
Also, the method is fast and will be processed within one of main threads, because the second input of its atribute at line 51 is false by default.</p>

<p>It is pointed out that you can use SocketProAdapter.ServerSide.CSocketProServer.PushManager to publish a message or send a message to a specific client by user id at server side too.</p>
<p>At last, it is noted that the number of main threads is one by default. The max number of main threads will not be more than the number of server processors at server side.
Our experiments show that one main thread is enough if your server doesn't use secure communication or inline compression/de-compression (zip).
The number of worker threads are dynamically created if neccessary. They are automatically destroyed too if they are idle for more than 60 seconds by default.</p>

<p>Additionally, SocketPro .NET adapter automatically registers a service and properly set its requests according to a given service attribute at line 3 of the above code snippet 2 and request attributes at lines 20, 39 and 51 of this snippet by use of .NET reflection.
Registering services and setting requests happens right after the virtual method OnSettingServer at line 7 of the above code snippet 2 is called. It also happens right before a listening socket is started.

It is time to focus the client side development as shown at the left code snippet 4. The sample project is at the directory ../socketpro/tutorials/csharp/pub_sub/ps_client.
<p>To enable secure communication at client side, you have to make sure connection context EncrytionMethod is set to tagEncryptionMethod.TLSv1 as shown at line 32.
Next, set certificate verification to a file as shown at line 37 for Linux.
On windows, you can put a root certificate into windows system store by mmc. At last, set a callback for authenticating certificates from servers, as shown at line 47 through 55. You can verify certificate chain as shown at line 52.
At last, client user id and password will be sent to server if the callback returns true. Otherwise, client user id and password will not be sent.</p>
<p>Codes at line 62 through 82 are for tracking messages from chat groups or topics.
Further, codes at line 84 through 90 are used for monitoring messages specifically for this client from other clients or server by calling the method SendUserMessage.</p>
<p>As an example, we can send a message to one or more groups or topics at line 100 from client side. In addition, we can also send messages to a client by its user id, as shown at line 108.</p>
<p>We can also do subscribe and unsubscribe from client side. Please refer to the member SocketProAdapter.ClientSide.CClientSocket.Push for details.</p>
<p>Now you can start the secure server, and run two or more instances of the client application for experiments.</p>
