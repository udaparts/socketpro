<h1 style="text-align: center;">SocketPro WebSocket for Client/server and Subscribe/publish Messaging on Browsers</h1>

The previous two articles <a href="cpp_hw.htm" title="SocketPro Client Server Application Development">here</a> and 
<a href="cpp_push.htm" title="SocketPro Secure Communication and Publish/Subscribe Messaging">here</a> shows SocketPro client/server and subscribe/publish messaging communnication patterns. 
SocketPro also fully supports client/server and subscribe/publish messaging on all browsers through SocketPro JavaScript adapter and websocket technology. 
It is noted that all requests are asynchronous. Further, you can also stream JavaScript requests for the best network efficiency as we have done in the <a href="cpp_hw.htm" title="SocketPro Client Server Application Development">previous article</a>.
It is remembered that SocketPro server always favors requests streaming for not only desktop/server applications but also web browser JavaScripts.

<p>The left code snippet 1 can be found at the file ../socketpro/tutorials/webtests/ws0.htm.
First, there is an optional global function onUHTTPLoaded used for tracking SocketPro JavaScript adapter loading event, as shown at line 22 through 24.
We start to build a websocket session to a SocketPro server inside, right after adapeter is loaded, by calling a connect button click function btnReconnect_onclick.
</p>
<p>
There is a global object named as UHTTP created after SocketPro JavaScript adapter is loaded.
We use it to build a websocket session by calling its method <b>connect</b> as shown at lines 29 through 39.
The method requires the first two inputs, user id and password.
The first lambda expression is used for tracking websocket connected event. The second one is for tracking websocket closed event.
We could automatically enable or disable buttons as shown at line 30 through 38.
The method has one more optional input for a channel string or url sub directory. At end, the method returns a SocektPro websocket object ws.
</p>
<p>
A SocektPro websocket object exposes a number of methods such as <b>close</b>, <b>isOpen</b> and <b>sendRequest</b> as well as one property push object as shown at line 40.
Here, the object push is an messenger as described at <a href="cpp_push.htm" title="SocketPro Secure Communication and Publish/Subscribe Messaging">the previous article</a>.
We can use it for tracking various messages from other clients as shown at line 41 through 43.
Certainly, we can use it to publish messages as shown at line 60 through 62.
The messenger push also supports sending a message to a specific client by user id as shown at line 63 through 66.
The first input of the method sendUserMessage is a message, and the second input is a user id.
It is noted that web browser messenger is fully integrated with other non web browser messengers.
</p>
<p>
The most important method of SocektPro websocket object is <b>sendRequest</b>. The method requires that the first input must be a method name as shown at lines 49 and 55.
Further, its last input of the method must be a callback for tracking its result from the connected remote SocektPro server.
The method <b>sendRequest</b> can additionally have zero, one or any numbers of inputs between the first and last inputs.
Remebering <a href="cpp_hw.htm" title="SocketPro Client Server Application Development">the first client/server example</a>, we implement the two methods <b>sayHello</b> and <b>sleep</b> here for browsers.
</p>
<p>At last, we need to load SocketPro JavaScript adapter right before HTML body ending by this JavaScript code: &lt;script type="text/javascript" src = "uloader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<p>We are going to do tests and like to get the left picture for a browser.
Before testing, you need to copy prepared files <b>earthcity.jpg</b> and <b>ws0.htm</b> from the directory ../socketpro/tutorials/webtests into the directory ../socketpro/bin/win/x64(or x86) for windows or ../socketpro/bin/linux for Linux.
You must also copy the two files <b>uloader.js</b> and <b>uwebsocket.js</b> from the directory ../socketpro/bin/js into the directory ../socketpro/bin/win/x64(or x86) for windows or ../socketpro/bin/linux for Linux.
Afterwards, run <a href="get_started.htm" title="Get Started With SocketPro">the pre-compiled all_servers server application</a> so that the application is able to access the four files.</p>
<p>You will get the left picture after running a browser with url http://localhost:20901/ws0.htm. Further, press the key F12 for browser built-in debug tool.</p>

<p>Let's look at UHTTP object. In addtion to the method <b>connect</b> as described before, it exposes the three more methods <b>count</b>, <b>host</b> and <b>version</b>.
The method <b>count</b> is used for querying the number of websocket sessions. The method <b>host</b> is for checking the connected SocketPro server ip address.
The method <b>version</b> is for checking the adapter version. All the three methods require no input. The object UHTTP exposes the other two properties, but you can just ignore them.</p>

<p>Let's look at the push object. In addition to the above two methods <b>speak</b> and <b>sendUserMessage</b>, it has methods <b>enter</b> and <b>exit</b> for subscribe and unsubscribe, respectively.
The first method <b>enter</b> requires an input for an arry of integers indicating topics or chat groups. The second one doesn't require an input. Next, its property onMessage is a callback for tracking messages from other clients as described before.
At last, the method <b>ws</b> is used to obtain the push object's creator. All the four methods <b>speak</b>, <b>sendUserMessage</b>, <b>enter</b> and <b>exit</b> can be given an optional callbacks at last for tracking their returning results.
</p>

<p>SocketPro websocket object <b>ws</b> is an asynchronous handler for web browsers. It supports streaming requests by calling the method <b>sendRequest</b> continuosly if you have multiple requests available.
In addition, you can maually batch a number of requests by doing somethig like: ws.beginBatching(); ws.sendRequest(....); ws.sendRequest(....); ......; ws.sendRequest(....); ws.commit(); .
Here, the methods <b>beginBatching</b> and <b>commit</b> are given for maual batching.
Occasionally, you may like to abort a manual batch by calling the method <b>rollback</b> instead of <b>commit</b>.
Sometimes, you can may want to use the method <b>isBatching</b> to check if there is a manual batch now, or query the number of batched requests by calling the method <b>getBatchSize</b>.</p>

<p>SocketPro websocket object alway transfers requests and results with JSON strings back and forth. You can use the method <b>msg</b> to get the last one. Each of requests will have a call index associated.
To get the last call index, call the method <b>callIndex</b>. You can use the method <b>count</b> to find the number of requests queued to be processed and returned from server.
Further, you can cancel requests queued previously by calling the method <b>cancel</b>.
You can use the methods <b>channel</b>, <b>pingTime</b>, <b>timeout</b>, <b>userId</b> and <b>script</b> to get url sub directory, ping time, request timeout, user id and internal websocket, respectively.</p>

<p>Except the method <b>sendRequest</b>, all SocketPro websocket object methods don't require an input argument at all. The method <b>commit</b> may take an optional boolean input.
If it is true, SocketPro will send results back to web browser in batch.</p>

<p>At last, you may like to turn on or off debugging at your will. To do so, go to the end of the above uloader.js (<b>}('spadapter.js', 1);</b>) and flip the second parameter between 0 or 1. You can see its action by turning on web browser built-in debugger.
If you like to see more insides at browser sides, you can use uwebsocket_debug.js at the directory ../socketpro/bin/js to replace uwebsocket.js.</p>

<p>Let's look at the left code snippet 2 for a server supporting http and webscoket services, which comes from the file ../socketpro/tutorials/cplusplus/webdemo/webpub.cpp. First, we start a listening socket server at lines 46 and 47.
Unlike <a href="cpp_push.htm", title="SocketPro Secure Communication and Publish/Subscribe Messaging">the previous article</a>, this simple server is non-secure for test simplicity.</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="cpp_push.htm", title="SocketPro Secure Communication and Publish/Subscribe Messaging">hello world service</a> at line 16, we are going to add a new service at line 27.
We register the new HTTP/websocket service at line 38. Further, we tell the server that the HTTP/websocket service supports three slow requests, GET, POST and UserRequest.
All of them will be processed with worker threads. All others within hello world service are ignored now as they are the same as described within <a href="cpp_push.htm", title="SocketPro Secure Communication and Publish/Subscribe Messaging">the previous article</a>.

<p>Although we use <a href="get_started.htm", title="Get Started With SocketPro">the pre-compiled all_servers</a> for testing, its server implementation is actually located at the file ../socketpro/tutorials/cplusplus/webdemo/httppeer.h.</p>
<hr />
<p>First, we disable all HTTP requests other than GET and POST from code line 17 through 35 as shown at the left code snippet 3.</p>
<p>Let's focus the virtual function OnSlowRequestArrive between line 37 and 70.
When a client sends HTTP method GET, the server will return a string at line 46 or download a file at line 44.
The inside picture of the above Figure 1 is actually from this code at line 44.</p>
<p>Now, look at code line 51 through 64. It is related with UserRequest which is not a HTTP method but is SocketPro JavaScript adapter method.
Recall the method names sayHello and sleep at the above code snippet 1. At server side, we can find a request name at line 39 by calling the method <b>GetUserRequestName</b>.
Further, we can get input arguments at line 40, which are originated from <b>sendRequest</b> at the above code snippet 1.
Once having the two pieces of data, we could route requests onto different methods to complete processing as shown at lines 52, 60 and 64. 
</p>
<p>In regards to the method sayHello at line 74 through 80, we returns a string. Also, we publish a message to two topics or grouups 2 and 3.</p>
<p>In regards to the method sleep at line 82 through 87, we returns nothing. Also, we publish a message to two topics or grouups 2 and 3.</p>
<p>Remember the method <b>connect</b> of UHTTP object at the code snippet 1, we pass user id and password to server side for HTTP/websocket authentication.
They are required before sending any other requests. This is completed with the virtual function DoAuthentication at code line 9 through 15.
Here, we permit a websocket session because it returns true.
Additionally, we subscribe for three topics, 1, 2 and 7 at line 13. You can do so at web browser sides too by calling the method <b>push.enter</b>.
